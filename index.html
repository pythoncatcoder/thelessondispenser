                    <h1>What Happened?</h1>
                    <p>It seems that someone was able to gain dangerous physical access to your computer. They could have installed malware, such as a rootkit, which would have allowed them to remotely access and control your computer, or ransomware such
                        as WannaCry, which would have held your files hostage and forced you to pay a ransom, most likely without actually getting the files back. Instead, fortunately for you, the hacker downloaded this explanatory webpage onto your computer,
                        with the help of a USB Rubber Ducky.</p>

                    <h1>A USB What?</h1>
                    <p>A Rubber Ducky, more formally known as a keystroke injection tool, is a small device, about the size of a normal USB flash drive. It is essentally a programmable keyboard: when the Ducky is plugged into a computer, it sends messages
                        that seem to the computer to be a person typing. In this way, anything that can be done with a keyboard can be done with a Rubber Ducky (albeit much faster, because it can type at a far greater speed than any real person). Thus,
                        the Rubber Ducky makes compromising an unprotected computer extremely fast. In fact, it took fewer than 10 seconds to put this site on your screen.</p>

                    <h1>How Can I Defend Myself?</h1>
                    <p>The first thing to do is to make sure you have a secure password on your computer. To make a password which is both strong and easy to remember, take four random, unrelated words, such as correct, horse, battery, and staple, and simply
                        separate them with spaces, in this case giving you "correct horse battery staple". Once this is in place, consider decreasing the time it takes for your screen to lock in Settings > Power and Sleep or Control Panel > System and
                        Security > Power Options > Edit Plan Settings. Finally, remember that by allowing someone to access your computer, you are allowing them to access your life.</p>
