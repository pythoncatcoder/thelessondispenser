#What Happened?
It seems that you left your computer unlocked and unattended. While it was sitting there, looking to every opportunistic hacker like a perfect opportunity. One such hacker noticed this vulnerability. They could have installed malware, such as a rootkit, which would have allowed them to remotely access and control your computer, or ransomware such as WannaCry, which would have held your files hostage and forced you to pay a ransom, most likely without actually getting the files back. Instead, fortunately for you, the hacker downloaded this explanatory webpage onto your computer, with the help of a USB Rubber Ducky.



#A USB What?
A Rubber Ducky, more formally known as a keystroke injection tool, is a small device, about the size of a normal USB flash drive. It is essentally a programmable keyboard: when the Ducky is plugged into a computer, it sends messages that seem to the computer to be a person typing. In this way, anything that can be done with a keyboard can be done with a Rubber Ducky (albiet much faster, because it can type at a far greater speed than any real person). There is also a thriving Rubber Ducky community which is constantly finding new ways to break into computers and new things to do once they've broken in.




#How Can I Defend Myself?
The first thing to do is to make sure you have a secure password on your computer. To make a password which is both strong and easy to remember, take four random, unrelated words, such as correct, horse, battery, and staple, and simply separate them with spaces, in this case giving you "correct horse battery staple". Once this is in place, consider decreasing the time it takes for your screen to lock in Settings > Power and Sleep or Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options > Edit Plan Settings. Finally, remember that by allowing someone to access your computer, you are allowing them to access your life.
